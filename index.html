<h2 id="where-i-ve-worked">Where I&#39;ve worked</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>From 2009 until now</p>
<p>  Worked in <a href="http://www.3logic.it">3logic mk</a>. I started as junior developer and became project leader and senior developer. I&#39;ve worked mainly on  <em>web stuff</em> but also on sensor/hardware interfaces</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Projects</p>
<p><strong>SmartHealth</strong> : Totally distributed health related data analysis platform. The project let you describe your sensors and analysis workflow and run in an environment powered by <em>Node.js</em>, <em>Cassandra</em>, <em>Rabbit MQ</em>, <em>Hadoop</em></p>
<p><strong>Automotive</strong>: In these years we designed and developed a lot of web for a <em>famous italian automotive company</em>.
A journalist portal, street-car line presentation, site of services for car owners and other. Developed mainly using <em>Wordpress</em>, this websites often have to support million of concurrent visitors (like in new <em>F1 car presentation</em>). Deployed on <em>Amazon AWS</em> I often control deployment architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Winmedical</strong>: Medical real-time monitoring software developed for <a href="http://www.winmedical.com/">winmedical</a>, it&#39;s now deployed in several hospitals all around the world, controlling patients in their wards. Based on <em>Node.js</em>, <em>CakePhp</em>, <em>Mongo DB</em> and <em>socket.io</em> (A former version of the gui is shown on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onMuIOySY0A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onMuIOySY0A</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong>: I managed projects for a big telecommunication company.[MISSING]</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>From 2010 until now</p>
<p>  Web development with <a href="http://www.obsidianart.com/wp/">obsidianart</a></p>
<p>  Web development with <a href="http://thesharkproject.com/">the shark project</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>From 2013 until now</p>
<p>  I&#39;ve worked as system administrator at <em>Dipartimento di Agraria, University of Pisa</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My work nowdays consists into <em>direct the development team</em> <em>review</em> and <em>organize</em> their code and codebase. Like counseling I review third-part code for an IT company when code is wrote for wordpress or, generically, in PHP or for complex <em>javascript</em> application.</p>
<h2 id="technologies-i-m-confident-with">Technologies I&#39;m confident with</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Php</strong>: Wordpress is the CMS for which I developed a lot. Obviously I work with <em>MVC frameworks</em> as Cake Php or <em>Laravel</em></li>
<li><strong>Javascript</strong>: It&#39;s my favorite programming language. I wrote some huge <em>single-page applications</em> (like for winmedical and not only) using <em>knockout</em> or <em>angular js</em> as frameworks.
I wrote a lot of NodeJS applications, for realtime communiation but even general purpose such as some <em>scrapers</em> or <em>libraries</em></li>
<li><strong>High level languages</strong> : I&#39;ve worked, mainly in the past with C# and Java. In C# I developed various projects using .NET framework: ASP.net, WCF, windows form and Microsoft MVC. I&#39;m not an expert anyway.
In Java I developed little Android applications, used RED5. Even these are not my strenghts.</li>
<li><strong>Git and others VCS</strong>: I&#39;m experienced with git and I also used SVN and Team Foundation System</li>
<li><strong>Databases</strong>: In sql-world I know Postgres, MySql and SQL Server (2005-8). About non-relational databases I&#39;m experienced with MongoDB and Cassandra.</li>
<li><strong>ElasticSearch</strong>: I&#39;ve developed custom search application using ES (for automotive company) taking care from system management to application building.</li>
<li><strong>System management</strong>: A huge part of my work has always been system integration. I learned a lot of tecnologies to make my work, and the work of my collagues, easier. So, in the years I set up development environments, starting from linux deployment systems arriving nowadays, to set up <em>Vagrant</em> environments. <em>Puppet</em> became a friend within <em>Grunt</em> and a bunch of <em>test suits</em>. I also dived into integration system, from self managed as <em>Jenkins</em> to online services such as <em>Travis-ci</em> and similar. I manage internal git repositories and server at 3logic and their linux based machines. Working with <em>Amazon AWS</em> I became confident with its services as <em>EC2</em>, <em>Cloudfront</em>, <em>S3</em> and its general service management.</li>
