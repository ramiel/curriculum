<li><p>From 2009 until now
Worked in <a href="http://www.3logic.it">3logic mk</a>. I started as junior developer and became project leader and senior developer. I&#39;ve worked mainly on  <em>web stuff</em> but also on sensor/hardware interfaces</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Projects</p>

<p><strong>Automotive</strong>: In ths years we designed and developed a lot of web for a <em>famous italian automotive company</em>.
A journalist portal, street-car line presentation, site of services for car owners and other. Developed mainly using <em>Wordpress</em>, this websites often have to support million of concurrent visitors (like in new <em>F1 car presentation</em>). Deployed on <em>Amazon AWS</em> I often control deployment architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Winmedical</strong>: Medical real-time monitoring software developed for <a href="http://www.winmedical.com/">winmedical</a>, it&#39;s now deployed in several hospitals all around the world, controlling patients in their wards. Based on <em>Node.js</em>, <em>CakePhp</em>, <em>Mongo DB</em> and <em>socket.io</em> (A former version of the gui is showed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onMuIOySY0A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onMuIOySY0A</a>)</p>

<p>My work nowdays consists into <em>direct the development team</em> <em>review</em> and <em>organize</em> their code and codebase. Like counseling I review third-part code for a IT company when code is written for wordpress or, generically, in PHP or for complex <em>javascript</em> application.</p>
<h2 id="technologies-i-m-confident-with">Technologies I&#39;m confident with</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Php</strong>: Wordpress is the CMS for which I developed a lot. Obviously I work with <em>MVC frameworks</em> as Cake Php or <em>Laravel</em></li>
<li><strong>Javascript</strong>: It&#39;s my favorite programming language. I wrote some huge <em>single-page applications</em> (like for winmedical and not only) using <em>knockout</em> or <em>angular js</em> as frameworks.
I wrote a lot of NodeJS applications, for realtime communiation but even general purpose such as some <em>scrapers</em> or <em>libraries</em></li>
<li><strong>High level languages</strong> : [TODO C# and Java experience]</li>
