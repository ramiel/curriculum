## Where I've worked

- From 2009 until now
Worked in [3logic mk](http://www.3logic.it). I started as junior developer and became project leader and senior developer. I've worked mainly on  _web stuff_ but also on sensor/hardware interfaces
  -  Projects
     **SmartHealth** : Totally distributed health related data analysis platform. The project let you describe your sensors and analysis workflow and run in an environment powered by *Node.js*, *Cassandra*, *Rabbit MQ*, *Hadoop*
     **Automotive**: In ths years we designed and developed a lot of web for a *famous italian automotive company*.
A journalist portal, street-car line presentation, site of services for car owners and other. Developed mainly using Wordpress, this websites often have to support million of concurrent visitors (like in new *F1 car presentation*). Deployed on *Amazon AWS* I often control deployment architecture.
   **Winmedical**: Medical real-time monitoring software developed for [winmedical](http://www.winmedical.com/), it's now deployed in several hospitals all around the world, controlling patients in their wards. Based on *Node.js*, *CakePhp*, *Mongo DB* and *socket.io* (A former version of the gui is showed on <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onMuIOySY0A>)
**Communication**: I managed projects for a big telecommunication company.[MISSING]

My work nowdays consists into *direct the development team* *review* and *organize* their code and codebase. Like counseling I review third-part code for a IT company when code is written for wordpress or, generically, in PHP or for complex *javascript* application.

## Technologies I'm confident with
 - **Php**: Wordpress is the CMS for which I developed a lot. Obviously I work with *MVC frameworks* as Cake Php or *Laravel*
 - **Javascript**: It's my favorite programming language. I wrote some huge *single-page applications* (like for winmedical and not only) using *knockout* or *angular js* as frameworks.
I wrote a lot of NodeJS applications, for realtime communiation but even general purpose such as some *scrapers* or *libraries*
 - **High level languages** : [TODO C# and Java experience]
