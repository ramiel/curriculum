## Look at my code

Even if most of my code is not showable due to license reasons you could give an eye to my [github account](https://github.com/ramiel) for public code.

## Other notes

I speak english and of course italian. I'm moving to Paris anyway so I'll learn french but I don't (still) speak it. I believe this is a key information for you to know!
