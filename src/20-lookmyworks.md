## Look at my code

Even if most of my code is not showable due to license reasons you could give an eye to my [github account](https://github.com/ramiel) for public code.

## Other notes

I speak english and of course italian. I'm in Paris since a couple of months so I'm learning french as well!  
I believe this is a key information for you to know!


Contact me for any question or for references.
